# Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as entry points and recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module the application needs.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

In this project, I will restructure my Awesome books app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. I will also practice the ES6 syntax that I have learned.
